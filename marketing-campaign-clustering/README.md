# Marketing Campaign Analysis

## Overview

This group project involves an exploratory data analysis and preprocessing of a marketing campaign dataset. The goal is to better understand customer behavior, demographics, and campaign responsiveness to inform future marketing strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset includes 2,240 customer records with the following main features:

* **Demographic Information:** Year of birth, income, family composition (number of kids and teenagers at home).
* **Purchase History:** Amount spent on various product categories (wine, fruit, meat, fish, sweets, gold).
* **Customer Engagement:** Number of purchases via different channels (web, catalog, store), frequency of web visits, responses to various marketing campaigns.
* **Education and Marital Status:** Categorical data converted into one-hot encoded columns for analysis.

## Objectives

* Analyze customer demographics and spending habits.
* Evaluate customer responsiveness to marketing campaigns.
* Identify key customer segments for targeted marketing.

## Methods

* Data loading and preliminary exploration using pandas.
* Data preprocessing and feature engineering:

  * Handling missing values
